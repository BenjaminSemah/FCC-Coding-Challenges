## 02/21 Diff Two Arrays

>Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only 
>found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, 
>return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.
>
>Note: You can return the array with its elements in any order.

```bash
function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  const newArr = [];
  return newArr;
}

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

With this challenge, you will be given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` as parameters of the `diffArray` function.

Your task is to create a function that provides all items that cannot be found in both arrays.

In other words, if an item can be found in both `arr1` and `arr2`, that item should not be included in the final array to be returned.

Now that we know what this challenge expects of us, let's go ahead and write some pseudocode so guide us when writing the actual code.

## Pseudocode

```
First, consider arr1.
  check if there is any item within arr1 which is not present in arr2
    if any such items are found, store them in a new array 
    we can call that array arr1Filter

Next, consider arr2.
  check if there is any item in `arr2` which is not present in arr1
    if any such items are found, store them in a new array 
    we can call that array arr2Filter

Create an array newArr
It should contain all the items in both arr1Filter and arr2Filter

Return newArr
```

## Solving the Challenge

### Using `.filter()` and `.includes()` method

We can employ the `.filter()` method to help us solve this problem. When the `.filter()` method is applied on an array, it returns a new array. This new array will contain items of the array on which it was applied that fulfills a given condition. Let's see a simple example below

```
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
const filteredItems = myArray.filter(num => num > 4);

console.log(filteredItems) // [5, 6, 7]
``` 
From our example, we get an array of 5, 6 and 7 logged in the console. This is because these are the numbers from `myArray` greater than 4 hence the only numbers that fulfills the condition num > 4

The `.includes()` method returns `true` or `false` indicating whether or not an array contains a certain item among its entries. Let's see an example 

```
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
console.log(myArray.includes(2)) // true
console.log(myArray.includes(8)) // false
```
With this understanding of the let's start writing the code to solve the problem at hand.

First, we'll filter through `arr1`, returning all items in `arr1` not included in `arr2`
Then, we'll filter through `arr2`, returning all items in `arr2` not included in `arr1`

```
  const arr1Filter = arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item))
  const arr2Filter = arr2.filter(item => !arr1.includes(item))
``` 
### Using the `...` spread syntax
Using the [spread syntax,](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/spread-operator) let's create an array that will contain the contents of both `arr1Filter` and `arr2Filter`

```
const newArr = [...arr1Filter, ...arr2Filter];
``` 
Finally, we return `newArr`;

```
return newArr;
``` 


Our `diffArray` function is now complete!

## Final Solution

```bash
function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {

  const arr1Filter = arr1.filter(item => !arr2.includes(item))
  const arr2Filter = arr2.filter(item => !arr1.includes(item))
  const newArr = [...arr1Filter, ...arr2Filter]

  return newArr;
}

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [4]
```
