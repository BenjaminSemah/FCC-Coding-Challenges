## 15/16 Mutations

>Return `true` if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.
>
>For example, `["hello", "Hello"]`, should return `true` because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.
>
>The arguments `["hello", "hey"]` should return `false` because the string `hello` does not contain a `y`.
>
>Lastly, `["Alien", "line"]`, should return `true` because all of the letters in `line` are present in `Alien`.

```bash
function mutation(arr) {

  return arr;
}

mutation(["hello", "hey"]);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

You are expected to complete the mutation function. This function accepts two strings as arguments. The challenge is to complete the function such that 
it checks if the first string contains all of the letters in the second string. See the examples provided above in the challenge description.

If it contains all the letters, the function should return `true`. If it does not, the function should return `false`.

Note: We're informed that the function should ignore case (that is whether a letter is lower case or upper case. 

## Pseudocode
```
Given two strings
  convert both strings to lower case
  loop through the second word
  for each letter of the second word
  check if it is included in the first word
  if you find a word not included in the first word
  return false
  otherwise, return true
```

## Solving the Challenge

To make things more simple, we will first convert both strings to lowercase. That way, it is easy to compare.

```
const firstWord = arr[0].toLowerCase()
const secondWord = arr[1].toLowerCase()
```
Next, we are going to loop through the second word. For every iteration of the loop, we want to check whether or not the current letter is inclcuded in `firstWord`.

If we come accross a letter that is not included in `firstWord`, we return `false`.

However, we return true after the loop. This will only be return when all the letters of `secondWord` are present in `firstWord`

```
  for (let i = 0; i < secondWord.length; i++) {
    if (!firstWord.includes(secondWord[i])) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
```

## Final Solution
```bash
function mutation(arr) {
  const firstWord = arr[0].toLowerCase()
  const secondWord = arr[1].toLowerCase()

  for (let i = 0; i < secondWord.length; i++) {
    if (!firstWord.includes(secondWord[i])) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
}

mutation(["hello", "hey"]); // false
```
