## 16/16 Chunky Monkey

>Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of `size` (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

```bash
function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  
  return arr;
}

chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

The chunky monkey challenge presents a function that takes two arguments. The first is an array `arr`. And the second `size` is a number. The challenge here is to complete the function 
such that it returns a new array. This new array should contain the same elements as the original array. However, the difference here is that the new array is going to be made of sub-arrays. 
These sub-arrays should have a length of the given size.

For example, given `(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2)`, the function should return `[ ["a", "b"] , ["c", "d"] ]`

Note all the elements "a", "b", "c", "d" are present in both input and output arrays. The only change is that the output array is made up sub-arrays. Each of these sub-arrays has a length of the given `size`. In this case `2`.

## Pseudocode
```
Given an array and a number(size)
  Initialise a variable (newArray) and set it to an empty array
  loop through the input array
  For every iteration
    push a slice of the array into the newArray
    The slice should start at current index (i) and end at (i + size)
  After every iteration
    increase i by the value of size (i + size)
  Return the value of finalArray after the loop is done running
```

## Solving the Challenge

As stated in the pseudocode above, let declare a variable and set its initial value to an empty array.
```
let finalArray = []
```
We then loop throught the given array. The loops begins at index 0 and keeps running as long as  `i < arr.length`. Note that the increment after every iteration is `i + size`.

```
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i = i + size) {
  finalArray.push(arr.slice(i, i + size))
}
```
For every iteration of the loop, we push a subArray into the finalArray. This subArray is a slice of the original array. The slice starts at the current value of `i` and ends at 
the value at the index of `i + size`.

This can be a bit tricky. If you're not familiar with the `.slice()`, I suggest you spend some few minutes reading on it to get a firm grasp of how it works.

```
return finalArray
```
Finally, we return `finalArray` and our function is complete.

## Final Solution
```bash
function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  let finalArray = [];

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i = i+size) {
    finalArray.push(arr.slice(i, i + size))
  }
  return finalArray;
}

chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2); // [["a","b"]["c","d"]]
```

## Congratulations!
You just cracked the 16th challenge in this series.
