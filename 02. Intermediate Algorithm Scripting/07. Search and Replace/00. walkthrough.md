## 07/21 Search and Replace

>Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.
>
>First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.
>
>Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).
>
>Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).
>
>Note: Preserve the case of the first character in the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word Book with the word dog, it should be replaced as Dog

```bash
function myReplace(str, before, after) {
  
  return str;
}

myReplace("A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", "jumped", "leaped");
```

## Understanding the Challenge

Just like the name suggests, this challenge requires us to search and replace a string in a sentence. The `myReplcace` function takes 3 arguments. 

The first is sentence `str`.

The second argument `before` is a string. This string is present in the given sentence `str`. And it is the word that we will be replacing. 

The third argument `after` is a string. This is what we will use to replace `before` in the given sentence.

Let's look at an example to make things clearer. Let's say we are given the following arguments. 

`myReplace("Go to the Store", "Store", "mall")`

Given these arguments, the function should return `"Go to the Mall"`. So the word `"Store"` has been replaced with the word `"Mall"`.

The challenge description provides a note that we are to preserve the case of the first character of the original word we're replacing. Going back to our example. The original word 
we are replacing is `"Store"`. The first character is an upper case "S". However, the word we are using to replace `"mall"` starts with a lower case "m". Since, the 
challenge expects us to preserve the case, we replaced `"Store"` with `"Mall"`(upper case M) and not `"mall"`(lower case m)

I hope that explanation was clear. If you need to read over again to get a better understanding, I encourage you to do so. Once you are ready, let's proceed.

## Pseudocode

```
Given 3 strings
i. A sentence (str)
ii. A word to be replaced (before)
iii. A replacing word (after)
   First, check whether the first letter of before is lower case or upper case
   If it is lower case
      Replace (before) with (after).
      Make sure first letter of after is in lower case
      Return resulting sentence
   If it is upper case
      Replace (before) with (after).
      Make sure first letter of after is in upper case
      Return resulting sentence
```

## Solving the Challenge

First, let's declare a variable that will hold the final string to be returned. Let's call it `finalStr`. And we will set its initial value to an empty string. 

```
let finalStr = "";
```
The next to do is to get the first character of both `before` and `after` and save them in a string. 
```
const firstB = before[0];
const firstA = after[0];
```
The challenge expects us to preserve the case of the first letter of `before`. So what we need to do now is to check whether the first letter of `before` which is now held is `firstB` is a lower case or upper case.

One way to do that is to compare `firstB` with `firstB` converted to a lower case. If it returns true, it means `firstB` is lower case. If it returns `false`, it means `firstB` is upper case.

```
firstB === firstB.toLowerCase()
```
The code snippet above will help us check if the first letter of `before` is lower case or upper case. 

If it is lower case, we want to replace `before` in `str` with `after`. But the first character of `after` should be lower case. In other words, if `firstB` is lower case, the `finalStr` should be equal to the code snippet below.

```
finalStr = str.replace(before, firstA.toLowerCase() + after.substring(1));
```
let's break down what is happening. 

We know the `firstB` is a lower case. So we are doing here is to replace `before` with `firstA.toLowerCase() + after.substring(1)`. `firstA.toLowerCase()` will convert the first charact of after to a lower case. And using the `.substring()` method, we concatenate it with the remaining letters in `after`. 
Using 1 as an argument for substring, we'll get all the letters of `after` starting the letter at index 1. Note, we already have the first letter at index 0, converted to lower case. 

We will do something if `firstB` is an upper case.

```
finalStr = str.replace(before, firstA.toUpperCase() + after.substring(1))
```
To put it together, we can use either the if else or the tenary operator.

```
  firstB === firstB.toLowerCase()
  ? finalStr = str.replace(before, firstA.toLowerCase() + after.substring(1))
  : finalStr = str.replace(before, firstA.toUpperCase() + after.substring(1))
```

We can now return `finalStr` and our function is complete!

```
return finalStr;
```

## Final Solution

```bash
function myReplace(str, before, after) {
  let finalStr = "";
  let firstB = before[0];
  let firstA = after[0];
  
  firstB === firstB.toLowerCase()
  ? finalStr = str.replace(before, firstA.toLowerCase() + after.substring(1))
  : finalStr = str.replace(before, firstA.toUpperCase() + after.substring(1))

  return finalStr;
}

myReplace("A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", "jumped", "leaped");
```
