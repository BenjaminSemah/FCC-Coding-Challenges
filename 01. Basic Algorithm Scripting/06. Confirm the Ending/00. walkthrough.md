## 06/16 Confirm the Ending

>Check if a string (first argument, `str`) ends with the given target string (second argument, `target`).
>
>This challenge can be solved with the `.endsWith()` method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

```bash
function confirmEnding(str, target) {

  return str;
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n");
```

## Understanding the Challenge

Here in this challenge, you'll be given two arguments. Both will be strings. The first string `str` and the second string `target`. Your task is to create a function that verifies whether the first string `str` ends with the same letters as the second string `target`.

For example if `str` is given as "hello" and `target` is "lo", your function should return true. However, if `str` is given as "coding" and `target` is "gin", your function should return false. 

Your function is thus expected to return a true or false based on whether the ending of `str` is the same as given `target`.  

## Pseudocode
```
Given str and target
  Extract the last x characters of str 
  (x should be equal to length of target)
  Compare last x characters of str to target
    Return true if they are equal and false if they are not
  
```

## Solving the Challenge

First, we need to find the last x characters of `str`. And x should be equal to the length of `target`. For example, if target has 

## Final Solution
```bash
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  const strLength = str.length;
  const subLength = str.length-target.length;

  const lastLetters = str.substring(subLength, strLength);
  return (lastLetters === target);
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n"); // true
```

## Congratulations!
You just cracked the sixth challenge in this series.
