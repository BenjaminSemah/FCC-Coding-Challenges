## 10/16 Boo who

>Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return `true` or `false`.
>
>Boolean primitives are `true` and `false`.

```bash
function booWho(bool) {

  return bool;
}

booWho(null);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

We are given a value `bool`. What we need to do to complete the function is to check whether the value is either `true` or `false`. If it is, then we return true. 
If it is not, then we return false.

This can be a bit tricky. 

Note: If the value `bool` is true, the function should return true. And if the value `bool` is false, the function should return true. This is because 
`true` is a boolean primitive and `false` is also a boolean primitive.

## Pseudocode
```
Given a value (bool)
  Check whether it is true or false
  if it is, return true
  if not, return false
```

## Solving the Challenge

As always, there are a number of ways to go about this challenge. For this one, we will use the 
tenary operator. 

The tenary operator works like this

```
condition ? code to execute if true : code to execute if false
```
First, you state a condition, followed by the question mark `?`, then you state the code to be run or returned 
if the condition is met. This is followed by the `:` and then you state the code to be run or returned if the 
condition is not met.

So in the case of this challenge, using the tenary operator will look like this

```
(bool === true || bool === false) ? true : false;
```
First we check if the provided value `bool` is true or false. If it is, we return `true`. if not, we return `false`.

Our function is now complete!

## Final Solution
```bash
function booWho(bool) {
  return (bool === true || bool === false) ? true : false;
}

booWho(null); // false
```

## Congratulations!
You just cracked the ninth challenge in this series.
