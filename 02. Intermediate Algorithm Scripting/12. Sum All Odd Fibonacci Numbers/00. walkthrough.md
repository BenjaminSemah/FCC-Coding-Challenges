## 12/21 Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
>Given a positive integer `num`, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to `num`.
>
>The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.
>
>For example, `sumFibs(10)` should return `10` because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `10` are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

```bash
function sumFibs(num) {

  return num;
}

sumFibs(4);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

In this, you are expected to create a function called `sumFibs()`.

The function takes a positive integer `num` as input. It then returns the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to `num`.

To get a better understanding of this challenge, you need first understand the Fibonacci sequence.

We are told in the challenge description that _"the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1."_ After these first two numbers, any number that comes next is the sum of the previous two numbers.

So the first six numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is as follows;
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Third number is 2 because 1 + 1 = 2.
Fourth number is 3 because 1 + 2 = 3.
Fifth number is 5 because 2 + 3 = 5.
Sixth number is 8 because 3 + 5 = 8.

You get the drill right?

So moving on, here's what the `sumFibs()` function in expected to do. Take an input `num` and return the **sum of all odd numbers in the Fibonacci sequence less than or equal to `num`**.

For example `sumFibs(10)` should return `10`

This is because the numbers in the Fibonacci less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. Of these, the ones that are odd numbers are 1, 1, 3 and 5. Therefore, 1+1+3+5 equals 10.

## Pseudocode

````
Given an integer (num)
  find all numbers in Fibonacci sequence less than or equal to num
  store them in an array (numsArray)
  filter numsArray to get only the odd numbers
  add all the numbers in the filtered array
return the sum
````

## Solving the Challenge



## Final Solution

```
function sumFibs(num) {
  let fibArray = [1, 1]
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    let prevNum1 = fibArray[fibArray.length-1]
    let prevNum2 = fibArray[fibArray.length-2]
    let fibNumber = prevNum1 + prevNum2

    if (fibNumber <= num) {
      fibArray.push(fibNumber)
    }
  }

  let fibOddNumbers = fibArray.filter(num => {
    return num % 2 == 1
  })

  let sum = 0
  
  fibOddNumbers.forEach(oddNum => {
    sum += oddNum
  })

  return sum;
}

sumFibs(4); // 5
```
