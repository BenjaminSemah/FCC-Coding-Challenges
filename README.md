## [Walkthrough & Solution] Algorithm & Data Structure Challenges
>This repo is a collection of JavaScript Solutions and Walkthroughs to common coding challenges. The challenges in this repo are taken from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 
>
>If you are beginner, the basic section will be a good place to start. These challenges are beginner friendly and you can follow along just fine. If you're a more advanced learner, you may choose to head to the intermediate section.

Each solution provided offers the following sections;
- The Challenge
- Understanding the Challenge 
- Pseudocode
- Solving the Challenge
- Final Solution
