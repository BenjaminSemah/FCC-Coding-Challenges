## 07/16 Repeat a String Repeat a String

>Repeat a given string `str` (first argument) for `num` times (second argument). 
>Return an empty string if `num` is not a positive number. 
>For the purpose of this challenge, do not use the built-in `.repeat()` method.

```bash
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  
  return str;
}

repeatStringNumTimes("abc", 3);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

In this challenge, you'll be given a string `str` as first argument of the function. And a number `num` as second argument.

Your task here is to complete the function such that it returns `str` repeated multiple times. In the given example, `str` is given as "abc" and `num` is given as `3`. In this case, the function is expected to return `abcabcabc`.

You've also been given two things to take note of. First, if `num` is not a positive number, return an empty. And secondly, "do not use the built-in `.repeat()` method."

## Pseudocode
```
Given a string(str) and a number(num)
  Check if num is a positive number
    if num is not a positive number
    return an empty string
    if num is a positive number
    return str repeated num times
```

## Solving the Challenge

First, we shall declare a variable and set it to an empty string. let's call it `finalString`
```
let finalString = ""
```

Next, we'll check whether `num` is positive or not. If num is not positive, that is num <= 0, we'll return finalString which is an empty string.
```
if (num <= 0) {
  return finalString
}
```
We can now add an `else` statement to handle a situation where `num` is positive. 
For positive `num`, we'll need a loop. We'll initiate the loop at `i = 1` and keep the loop running as long as `i <= num`.

For each iteration, concatenate the given string `str` to the current value of `finalString`

```
if (num <= 0) {
  return finalString
} else {
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    finalString += str;
  }
  return finalString;
}
```

We return `finalString` after the loop is done. Our `repeatStringNumTimes` is now complete!

## Final Solution
```bash
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  let finalString = "";

  if (num <= 0) {
    return finalString;
  } else {
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
      finalString += str
    }
    return finalString;
  }
}

repeatStringNumTimes("abc", 3); // abcabcabc
```

## Congratulations!
You just cracked the seventh challenge in this series.
