## 05/16 Return Largest Numbers in Arrays

>Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.
>
>Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax `arr[i]`.

```bash
function largestOfFour(arr) {

  return arr;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

In this challenge, you will be provided with an array containing 4 sub-arrays. 
Your task is to create a function that return a new array. 
This new array should contain the largest numbers found in each of the sub-arrays.

## Pseudocode
```
Given an array of sub-arrays
  iterate through the array
  For each iteration 
    return the largest number in the sub-array
Return an array of all largest numbers
```

## Solving the Challenge

So here, we have a given array of sub-arrays. We need to iterate through this given array. There are a number of ways to do so. To keep things simple, let's use the `.map()` method.

We'll map through the given array. For every iteration, we'll have a `subArray` available to us. Using `Math.max()`, we can return the largest number in each `subArray`.

```bash
  const largeNums = arr.map(subArray => {
    return Math.max(...subArray);
  })
```
Note: We are using the `...` spread operator to get all the numbers in the `subArray`.

Using the [.map() method](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/4-uses-of-javascripts-arraymap-you-should-know), we will get a new array made up of the the large numbers in each sub array.

We can then return this new array, in this case `largeNums` and our function is complete!

```bash
return largeNums;
```

## Final Solution
```bash
function largestOfFour(arr) {
  const largeNums = arr.map(subArray => {
    return Math.max(...subArray);
  })
  return largeNums;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]); // [ 5, 27, 39, 1001 ]
```
