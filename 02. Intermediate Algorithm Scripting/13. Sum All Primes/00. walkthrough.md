## 13/21 Sum All Primes

>A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. 
>For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. 
>In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.
>
>Rewrite `sumPrimes` so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.
```bash
function sumPrimes(num) {

  return num;
}

sumPrimes(10);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

In this challenge, you are expected to complete the `sumPrimes()` function.

This function takes a number `num` as argument. And it should return the sum of all primes numbers that are less than or equal to `num`.

As explained in the challenge description, _"a prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself."_ 

Let's do some pseudocoding before we proceed.

## Pseudocode
```
Given a number (num)
  create a variable sum which will hold final answer
  Loop through numbers less than or equal num
  For each iteration, check if number is a prime number
    if it is, add the number to num
Return the value of sum after the loop is done.
```

## Solving the Challenge

For this challenge, we'll create another function within the `sumPrimes()` function (a helper function). The purpose of this function would be to check whether a number is prime or not. Let's call it `checkPrime()`.

To create the `checkPrime()` function, we need a loop. This loop will start from 2 `i = 2`, and end at the square root of num `i <= Math.sqrt(num)`

We start from `i < 2` because we know 1 is not a prime number. Therefore, there's no need for the `checkPrime()` to deal with 1. Also, we end at `i <= Math.sqrt(num)` because the square root of a number is the highest possible divisor that exist. Therefore, that there's no need for our function to go beyond that. 

```bash
function sumPrimes(num) {

  function checkPrime(num) {
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i == 0)
      return false;
    }
    return true;
    }
  }

}
```

For every iteration of the loop, we check if the given number `num` modulo `i` is equal to zero. If it is equal to zero, then it means that number is a divisor of `num`. This means `num` is not a prime number because it has more more than 2 divisors so the `checkPrime()` function returns `false`.

However, if after the loop, there was no case of `num` modulo `i` equalling zero, then it means `num` has only two divisors (1 and `num` itself). In that case, `checkPrime()` returns `true`. 

Now that we have a function to help us check whether or a number is a prime number, we can use that function to find all prime numbers less than or equal to `num`

We would declare a variable `sum`. For any number less than or equal to `num` that returns `true` for the `checkPrime()` function, we would add it to `sum`
```bash
let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
    if (checkPrime(i)) {
        sum += i;
    }
  }
````
Finally, we return `sum`. Our function is complete! 
```bash
return sum;
```

## Final Solution

```bash
function sumPrimes(num) {
  
  function checkPrime(num) {
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i == 0)
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }

  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
    if (checkPrime(i)) {
        sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

sumPrimes(10) // 17;
```
