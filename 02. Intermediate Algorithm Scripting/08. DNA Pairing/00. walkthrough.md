## 08/21 DNA Pairing

>The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array.
>
>Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to the provided character.
>
>Return the provided character as the first element in each array.
>
>For example, for the input `GCG`, return `[["G", "C"], ["C","G"], ["G", "C"]]`
>
>The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays are grouped into one encapsulating array.

```bash
function pairElement(str) {
  
  return str;
}

pairElement("GCG");
```

## Understanding the Challenge

In the DNA Pairing challenge, we are expected to use [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair) provide the corresponding pairing letter for each given letter. 
The challenge description informs us that base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. This means that A always goes with T. And C always goes with G.

Also, we are told that the provided character should always be the first letter in the pairing. For example, If A is given, then the pair to be return should be `[["A", "T"]]`. However, 
if T is the given letter, then the pair to be returned will be [["T", "A"]]. The same goes for "C" and "G".

Note how the return value is a 2d array (an array with sub-arrays). This is part of the requirements for this challenge. Okay, now let's penned down some pseudocode before we dive into it.

## Pseudocode

```
Given a string of characters,
  Create an empty array to hold all pairings (finalArray) 
    Check the provided letters
    if a letter is "A"
      pair it with "T" in an array
      push the array into finalArray
    if a letter is "T"
      pair it with "A" in an array
      push the array into finalArray
    if a letter is "C"
      pair it with "G" in an array
      push the array into finalArray
    if a letter is "G"
      pair it with "C" in an array
      push the array into finalArray
 Return finalArray
```

## Solving the Challenge

Considering our pseudocode above, we can solve this challenge using the `if` and `else if` statements. However, this is a good case where using 
the `switch` statement will be more appropriate to use. Using the `switch` statement in such a case will help you write a more readable code. 

If you're not familiar with the `switch` statement, I will encourage you to first solve this problem with the `if` and `else if` statements. Then 
you learn about the `switch` statement. I've provided a link to a tutorial in the **Useful Links** section below. 

When you've learned the syntax of the `switch` statement, come back to this challenge and see how solving it with `switch` differs.

Okay, now let's get into the solution.

First, let's create a variable that would hold the final array to be returned. We will call it `finalArray`.

```
let finalArray = [];
```
The next thing we will done is to use a `for loop`. We want to loop through all the given letters. Then, for every given letter, we'll use the `switch` statement to check what letter it is and determine how it will be paired.

```
for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  switch(str[i]) {
  
  }
}
```
To use the `switch`, we write the keyword `switch` followed by parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis, we state what will be checking. In this case, what we're going to check for every iteration of the loop is the letter whether it is "A", "T", "G" or "C".

Then, we use the key word `case` for the individual cases and determine what should happened in each of the cases.

```
 case 'A':
  finalArray.push(["A", "T"])
  break;
```
The above code snippet shows that when the given letter is `A`, our function should push a sub-array of `["A", "T"]` into the `finalArray`. If the case is fulfilled, we break out of the switch and move to the next iteration of the loop. We'll do the same thing for all the available cases (or letters in this challenge.)

```
case 'T':
  finalArray.push(["T", "A"])
  break;
case 'C':
  finalArray.push(["C", "G"])
  break;
case 'G':
  finalArray.push(["G", "C"])
  break;
default:
  return  "value cannot be paired";
```
It is best practice to always have a default case in your `switch` to cater for unexpected cases. For example, assuming a user provides an input of "B". In our function the letter "B" cannot be paired. So your `switch` statement should be able to inform your users of that.

Now, we return our `finalArray` and our function is complete.

```
return finalArray;
```

## Final Solution

```bash
function pairElement(str) {
  let finalArray = [];

  for (let i=0; i<str.length; i++) {
    switch(str[i]) {
      case 'A':
        finalArray.push(["A", "T"])
        break;
      case 'T':
        finalArray.push(["T", "A"])
        break;
      case 'C':
        finalArray.push(["C", "G"])
        break;
      case 'G':
        finalArray.push(["G", "C"])
        break;
      default:
        return 'value not found';
    }
  }
  return finalArray;
}

pairElement("GCG");
```
