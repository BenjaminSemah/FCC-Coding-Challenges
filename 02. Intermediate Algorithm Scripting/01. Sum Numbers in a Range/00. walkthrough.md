## 01/21 Sum Numbers in a Range

>We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers 
>plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.
>
>For example, `sumAll([4,1])` should return `10` because sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is `10`.

```bash
function sumAll(arr) {
  return 1;
}

sumAll([1, 4]);
```

## Understanding the Challenge

In this challenge, we are given two numbers in an array.

Our tasks is to add those numbers plus all the numbers between them.

In the given example, we have `sumAll([4,1])` This should return the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, which is `10`.

Another example might be `sumAll([6,8])` This should return `21`, that is 6 + 7 + 8.

Now that we know what this challenge expects of us, let's go ahead and write some pseudocode that will guide us when writing the actual code.

Note: We're also informed "the lowest number will not always be the first number"

## Pseudocode

```
Sort the given array arr in ascending order. 

Create a new variable finalSum with an initial value of 0.

Create a loop initialized at the value of the smallest number
  For every iteration, add the current number i to finalSum
  keep the loop running as long as i <= highest number

Return finalSum
```

## Solving the Challenge

First, we need to find a way of knowing which of the two numbers in the given array is the lowest and which is the highest. There are many ways of doing that. One way is to use the `.sort()` method. With this method, we can sort the array in ascending order. That way, the lowest number will be the first number in the arr and the highest number will be the second number.

```
let sorted = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)
```
The code above returns a sorted version of `arr` in ascending order. Basically, we are using the `.sort()` method and we've given it an ES6 arrow function as a parameter. What this function does is to compare the values in the given `arr`. It then returns a version of `arr` which has the lowest number as the first number and the highest number as the second. 

I've linked a short article in the useful links section below which provides a thorough explanation of the `.sort()` method.

Next, we create a variable to hold the `finalSum` with an initial value of `0`.

```
let finalSum = 0;
```

We can then use a for loop to find the sum of the two numbers and all numbers between.

Note that the lowest number is now at `sorted[0]` and the highest at `sorted[1]`

```
for (let num = sorted[0]; num <= sorted[1]; num++) {
  finalSum += num;
}
```

Finally, we return the value of `finalSum`.


Our `sumAll()` function is now complete!

## Final Solution

```bash
function sumAll(arr) {
  let sorted = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let finalSum = 0;

  for (let num = sorted[0]; num <= sorted[1]; num++) {
    finalSum += num;
  };

  Return finalSum;
};

sumAll([1, 4]); // 10
```

### When you're ready, move on the third challenge. 

Cheers and happy coding!
