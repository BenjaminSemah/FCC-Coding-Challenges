## 06/16 Confirm the Ending

>Check if a string (first argument, `str`) ends with the given target string (second argument, `target`).
>
>This challenge can be solved with the `.endsWith()` method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

```bash
function confirmEnding(str, target) {

  return str;
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n");
```

## Understanding the Challenge

Here in this challenge, you'll be given two arguments. Both will be strings. The first string `str` and the second string `target`. Your task is to create a function that verifies whether the first string `str` ends with the same letters as the second string `target`.

For example if `str` is given as "hello" and `target` is "lo", your function should return true. However, if `str` is given as "coding" and `target` is "gin", your function should return false. 

Your function is thus expected to return a true or false based on whether the ending of `str` is the same as given `target`.  

## Pseudocode
```
Given str and target
  Find length of str
  Extract the last x characters of str 
  (x should be equal to length of target)
  Compare last x characters of str to target
    Return true if they are equal and false if they are not
```

## Solving the Challenge

First let's declare a variable `strLength`. We will assign to this variable the length of `str`.

```
const strLength = str.length;
```

Next, we need to find the last `x` characters of `str`. And keep in mind that `x` should be equal to the length of `target`.

To get that we need to first subtract the length of that `target` from the length of `str`. Let's assign that to a variable called `subLength`

```
const subLength = str.length - target.length;
```

Now, we can use `.substring()` to get the last `x` letters of the given string. Let's assign the result to a variable called `lastLetters`

```
const lastLetters = str.substring(subLength, strLength);
```
The `.substring()` helps us to extract part of a string. The first argument, which in this case is `subLength` helps us to get the starting point of the extraction. And the second argument helps us to get the end point of the extraction. In this case, because we are using `strLength`, the end point of the extraction will always be the end of the given string.

Now, all that is left to do is to compare the variable `lastLetters` with the given `target`. 

```
return (lastLetters === target);
```

If they're equal, our function should return `true`. Otherwise, our function should return `false`

## Final Solution
```bash
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  const strLength = str.length;
  const subLength = str.length - target.length;

  const lastLetters = str.substring(subLength, strLength);
  return (lastLetters === target);
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n"); // true
```

## Congratulations!
